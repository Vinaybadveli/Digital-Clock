# Digital-Clock
The digital clock is a graphical representation of time that displays hours, minutes, and seconds numerically rather than using traditional clock hands. In this HTML and CSS implementation:

HTML:

+ The HTML structure typically involves a container element, such as a div, to hold the digital clock display.
+ Inside this container, the individual digits for hours, minutes, and seconds are usually represented by separate elements, such as span or div. These elements will be styled using CSS to create the appearance of segmented digits.
+ Optionally, labels for each segment (e.g., "HOURS", "MINUTES", "SECONDS") can be added for clarity and accessibility.

CSS:

+ CSS is used to style the digital clock, including setting the font family, size, color, and alignment of the digits.
+ To create the appearance of segmented digits, CSS techniques such as borders, padding, and margins are commonly used. Each digit is typically composed of seven segments (or fewer for simpler designs), arranged in a pattern resembling a digital display.
+ CSS animations or transitions can be applied to create visual effects such as blinking colons between hours, minutes, and seconds, or smooth transitions when the time changes.
Overall, the digital clock created using HTML and CSS provides a modern and visually appealing way to display the current time on a webpage, suitable for various applications ranging from simple personal projects to professional websites.
